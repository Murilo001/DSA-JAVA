## Introduction

Data Structures and Algorithms form the foundation of computer science. This project serves as a practical guide to understanding and implementing fundamental data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and algorithms such as searching, sorting, dynamic programming, and greedy algorithms.

Each topic includes:
- Java code implementations
- Time and space complexity analysis
- Explanations and comments for clarity

## Technologies

This project is built with:
- **Java 21** or above
- **JUnit** for testing
- **Maven** (or Gradle) for project build and dependency management
